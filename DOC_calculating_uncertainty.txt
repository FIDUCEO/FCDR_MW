Relations between scripts and functions for calculating the
uncertainty

Imke Hans, 28.09.2016

The overall script to run is “process_uncertainty.m”. Below, it is shown which
functions (F) or scripts (S) are called or executed respectively.
The script was designed for producing the results to be presented at the
Hamburg Meeting in July 2016. It is therefore in no publishable state. Further, it
only deals with the three chosen effects that have an influence on the final
measured Tb. It uses uncertainty estimates that we had at that time. It is far from
being complete as it only considers these three effects and applies no filtering of
any bad data. It evaluates the measurement equation from that stage in July 2016
and calculates the uncertainty using the partial derivatives for each effect,
specified in the traceability chain document.

NOTE: the script atmlab_init initializes atmlab, a matlab package available from
http://www.radiativetransfer.org/tools/ (atmlab_init is contained in the
package). In the above scripts and functions a few functions from this package
are used.
